# TIDAL MCP: My Custom Picks 🌟🎧

Most music platforms offer recommendations — Daily Discovery, Top Artists, New Arrivals, etc. — but even with the state-of-the-art system, they often feel too "aggregated". I wanted something more custom and context-aware.

With TIDAL MCP, you can ask for things like:
> *"Based on my last 10 favorites, find similar tracks — but only ones from recent years."*
>
> *"Find me tracks like those in this playlist, but slower and more acoustic."*

The LLM filters and curates results using your input, finds similar tracks via TIDAL’s API, and builds new playlists directly in your account.
